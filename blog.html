                  <p><strong class="text-xl">Var </strong> <br>

                    The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window. <strong>var variables can be re-declared and updated.</strong> 
                    
                    
                    <br><br><strong class="text-xl">let </strong> <br> is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves some issue with var. let is block scoped
                    A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block.So a variable declared in a block with let  is only available for use within that block. <strong>let can be updated but not re-declared.</strong> 
                    
                    <br><br><strong class="text-xl">Const </strong> <br>
                    Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations. <strong>const cannot be updated or re-declared.</strong> 
                    This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared.</p>

                  <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags. Tags are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as parameters and are great for converting strings to different entities.

                    The syntax for creating template strings is by using backticks to delimit them.</p>

                  <p>.forEach(), .map(), .filter() and .find() all of them work on arrays but they have different use cases. .forEach() is great when need to execute a function for each individual element in an array. .map() function is used when needed to  transform elements in an array. .filter() function is used when needed to select a subset of multiple elements from an array. .find() function is used when needed to select a single element from an array.
